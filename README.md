## NO p5js! (@RONAK)
- only plain js (so its super fast)
- it was a lot harder than p5js to build, but arguably looks better and is definetily faster
- **note**: i know this code is really repetative and probably the least efficient program ive written but i couldnt figure out how to do the delay in a loop since it would loop faster than the delay time. pls make a pull req if you know how to do it thanks

## Effects
- supposed to have line fade effect, blowout effect (no color change effect yet)

## a few things
- maybe they are too big lol
- maybe its too late lol
